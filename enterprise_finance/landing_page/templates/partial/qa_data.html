                        <p class="mt-2 text-muted">The system starts by capturing company and employee financial data,
                            including earnings and deductions.
                            Users select a payroll month and define payroll components, then initiate payroll processing
                            for that period.
                            Adjustments can be made for errors or updates—such as missing earnings or incorrect
                            deductions—by linking original and current payroll periods.
                            The system calculates gross pay, tax, pension, and net pay automatically and updates
                            adjusted and recorded values accordingly.
                            Reports, journal entries, and expense summaries are generated to ensure accuracy,
                            transparency, and traceability.</p>

                            Select the payroll month and relevant components, then go to “Make Payroll by Month” and

                            Add or update earnings and deductions as needed—multiple personnel can be processed in the

                        <p class="mt-2 text-muted">
                            An adjustment is made when an error or update—such as a missing earning, incorrect
                            deduction, or when additional earning or deduction is needed—is discovered after the
                            original payroll period.
                            The user selects the payroll component to adjust and the reason for the adjustment (e.g.,
                            underpayment, overpayment, correction).
                            They then link the original payroll needing correction (payroll_needing_adjustment) to the
                            affected period and assign the current payroll (record_month) where the adjustment will
                            be recorded.
                            After entering the adjustment amount, the system automatically calculates the taxable and
                            non-taxable portions, updates the corrected values for the original period (adjusted_month_*
                            fields), and updates the totals in the current period (recorded_month_* fields), including
                            tax, pension, and expense figures.
